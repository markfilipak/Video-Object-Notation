<B class="yellow">Cine-slow</B>. Cinema that has been frame encoded (aka "progressive") & forced to 24'1.001pfps.<BR>
<B class="wheat">24pps]24'1.001pfps.a.resample("1.001")</B>
<P>&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;Due to 24pps-to-24'1.001pfps forcing, each cinema hour is stretched by 3.6 seconds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;Audio: Stretched video means slower dialog.
Slower dialog means more audio samples.
More audio samples means audio resampled by 1.001, to 48.048kHz, so when played at 48kHz, it is slightly slower (and also 2 cents flat, very little but apparently enough to make some musicians unhappy).</P>

<BR>
<B class="yellow">'PAL'-fast</B> (aka "PAL speed-up"). Cinema that has been unweaved & field encoded & forced to 25ftfps.<BR>
<B class="wheat">24pps_hpps]25ftfps.a.resample("24/25")</B><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;Due to 24pps-to-25tfps forcing, each cinema hour shrinks by 2 minutes 24 seconds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;Audio: Shrunken video means faster dialog.
Faster dialog means fewer audio samples.
Fewer audio samples means audio resampled by 24/25, to 46.080kHz, so when played at 48kHz, it is a little more than 4% faster (and also 71 cents sharp, almost 3/4 of the way from C to C# for example and easily discerned).</P>
